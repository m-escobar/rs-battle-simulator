# RUST Battle Simulator
A Battle Simulator in Rust Language, running in console.

This project was build to practice Rust language, only with learning purpose.

## The game

In this game you will run a player that can be a knight from Camelot, or a giant monster like King Kong!

This project was based on the [same game](https://github.com/m-escobar/lua-battle-simulator) in Lua Language.

Some game logic have been improved in this version, like check the player and opponent actions against each other.

Also the final version will include some sound effects, just to make this a little funny, and also to play with the audio crates.


All sounds are free from https://mixkit.co/ website.
